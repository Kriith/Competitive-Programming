# Competitive-Programming

This repository contains my solutions to various competitive programming problems across different platforms. The goal of this repository is to serve as a collection of my solutions, algorithms, and approaches to help with learning and practicing problem-solving skills.

## Contents

- Solutions to problems from platforms such as [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/), [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/), and others.
- Algorithms and data structures I have implemented and learned.
- Various problem-solving techniques including dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, graph algorithms, etc.

## Directory Structure and Naming Conventions

- All of the code is kept inside the master branch of the repository.
- Each folder either represents a platform, a collection of set of problems or a Codeforces contest(eg: 2074 represents the Codeforces Round 1009 which was the contest no. 2074)
- Inside the folder, you will find the solutions to individual problems.


## Setup and Usage

To start using the code in this repository, simply clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kriith/Competitive-Programming.git
cd Competitive-Programming
